## Software Engineer since 2008 ðŸš€

Yes, I'm "designed websites with tables" old ðŸ‘€, but I've learnt a thing or two in my time in-front of a monitor. Proficient in both front- and back-end technologies, my focus is on writing APIs and practical tools and utilities, primarily with `C#`.

I love building CLI tools, exploring other people's code, and writing solid READMEs. If you're into programming, tiny side projects, factory-building games, or board games, hit me up on [~~Twitter~~ X](https://twitter.com/criticalsession). Or, if you're the kind of person who actually browses LinkedIn, well... [there's that too](https://linkedin.com/in/amantereale).

### Project Highlights

- [Magic Episode Sort (v2)](https://github.com/criticalsession/Magic-Episode-Sort-v2): A Windows app that organizes TV show episode files into a structured show/season format based on filename markers (e.g., S03E02). Highly customizable, pulls episode names from TVMaze for renaming, and built with C# WPF.
- [game-deal](https://github.com/criticalsession/game-deal): A CLI tool (written in Go) that tracks game sales. Add games to your wishlist and find deals across multiple stores using the CheapShark API.
- [4watchan](https://github.com/criticalsession/4watchan): A Python CLI tool for monitoring and auto-downloading new images and videos from 4chan threads. Perfect for keeping up with fast-moving threads.
- [Thumbnailit](https://github.com/criticalsession/thumbnailit): A command-line tool that extracts thumbnails from a video file and arranges them in a grid. Quick and easy video preview generation.
- [CodeConjure](https://github.com/criticalsession/CodeConjure) *(work in progress)*: A C# tool that simplifies class and SQL table generation with a templating system. Define templates in text files, and let CodeConjure do the rest.
