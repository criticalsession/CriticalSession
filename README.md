# CriticalSession

## Software Engineer since 2008 ðŸš€

Yes, I'm designed-websites-with-tables old ðŸ‘€, but I've learnt a thing or two in my time in-front of a monitor. Proficient in both front- and back-end technologies, my focus is on writing APIs and practical tools and utilities.

I work with C# and Vue primarily, but I've recently fallen in love with Go. 

I love writing CLI tools and reading other people's code. Please, checkout the pinned repositories below and get in touch on [~~Twitter~~ X](https://twitter.com/criticalsession) if you wanna talk programming, projects, factory-building games, and/or board games. Or check out [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/amantereale) if you're the type of person to, like, browse LinkedIn. 

Thanks for reading! ðŸ‘‹ See ya in the pull requests.

PS: I use Vim, btw.
