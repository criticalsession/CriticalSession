## Software Engineer since 2008 ðŸš€

Yes, I'm "designed websites with tables" old ðŸ‘€, but I've learnt a thing or two in my time in-front of a monitor. Proficient in both front- and back-end technologies, my focus is on writing APIs and practical tools and utilities.

I work with `C#` and `Vue` primarily, but I've recently fallen in love with `Go`. 

I love writing CLI tools, reading other people's code, and writing READMEs. Check out the project highlights below and get in touch on [~~Twitter~~ X](https://twitter.com/criticalsession) if you wanna talk programming, projects, factory-building games, and/or board games. Or check out [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/amantereale) if you're the type of person to browse LinkedIn for some reason.

### Project Highlights

- [Magic Episode Sort (v2)](https://github.com/criticalsession/Magic-Episode-Sort-v2) is a Windows application that lets you sort TV show episode files into a show/season directory structure using markers in the filename (e.g., S03E02). It's highly customizable, uses the TVMaze API to retrieve episode names (for renaming files) and is written in C# WPF. 
- [game-deal](https://github.com/criticalsession/game-deal) is a CLI tool written in Go that helps you find sales for games. Add games to your wishlist and search for game deals across multiple stores using the CheapShark API.
- [4scraper](https://github.com/criticalsession/4scraper) is another CLI tool written in Go. Use 4scraper to search threads on 4chan, pick a thread, and download all images and videos from that thread.
- [CodeConjure](https://github.com/criticalsession/CodeConjure) is a **work in progress** and in early stages. Written in C#, CodeConjure lets you define C# classes using an easy to learn and use templating system. Write templates in text files and CodeConjure generates C# classes and SQL tables for you.
